== Motivation

Markdown is probably the most widely deployed proof that worse is, in fact,
worse footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better].

Markdown's ability to mark up text is so limited that it is virtually unusable
for anything but a short text of approximately the scope of an email -- yet,
markdown never saw adoption for email, and, tbh, plain-text emails using
markdown conventions mostly don't read very fluently. Without resorting to one
of its manifold "flavours" -- which, of course, is only understood by one
particular toolchain -- it is grossly inappropriate for writing technical
documentation.

So why do we keep using it?

Well, yeah, it's ubiquitous, we remember the five syntax elements supported by
GitHub via muscle memory, and -- of course -- we use GitHub every day and want
our prose to look reasonably good when rendered online there.

While headings, lists, reference links, and bold/italic text might be sufficient
for authoring an RFC, the consequence of markdown's limitations is that we are
in fact using _three_ markdown languages: GitHub-flavoured for RFCs,
<<pandoc>>-flavoured for specification, and <<docusaurus>>-flavoured for
user-facing documentation. Which flavour shall it be when we get to man pages,
installation instructions, API documentation, _et cetera_?

It would be highly desirable to reduce the babylonian flavouredness, and settle
on a single markup language which:

* is easy on the eyes when viewed as plain-text (eg. in diffs)
* is rendered as HTML in repo browsers of major forges, preferably in a
  consistent, un-flavoured way
* is supported by _some_ static site generators, or can be converted
* rendered views degrade gracefully in restricted environments (eg. GitHub)
* yet provides rich enough syntax to author complex technical documentation
* supports a variety of output formats
* provides a toolchain which makes it strictly less painful to reproduce the
  output across software versions than LaTeX


== Alternatives

The restriction to have pages rendered automatically in forge repo browsers
narrows down the choice to _AsciiDoc_ <<asciidoc>> and _reStructured Text_
<<rst>>. Their feature sets are more or less on par, and it is largely a matter
of personal taste to prefer one over the other. The author's preference is
_AsciiDoc_, because its syntax _somewhat_ more familiar for markdown users (and
less _pythonic_). In case of a majority vote, he would be happy to amend the
proposal in favour of _reStructured Text_, however.

== Migration

* Use _kramdown_ <<kramdown>> to convert existing RFCs and specification
  fragments to _AsciiDoc_
* Retire the _Pandoc_ build pipeline, which stores the output in the repository
* Use _AsciiDoc_ henceforth

== Tooling

_Asciidoctor_ <<asciidoctor>> is an easy to install and use converter. _Pandoc_
also accepts AsciiDoc.

== Drawbacks

Muscle memory needs to be re-wired, both for maintainers and contributors. This
is considered to improve mental agility and longevity, however
footnote:[citation needed].

== Recommendation

Use _AsciiDoc_
